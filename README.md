# Calculator with Light and Dark Mode

This project is a simple yet fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As part of my Codsoft internship (Task 2 of Level 1), I developed this calculator with a user-friendly interface and added the feature to switch between light and dark modes for better usability.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Toggle between light mode and dark mode to suit user preference
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the calculator
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator and implementing light and dark modes
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and functionality

## Skills Learned

- Front-end development
- Responsive design
- JavaScript programming
- UI/UX design principles
